# Logistic Regression

### What is logistic Regression
   - Used for classification problems
   - Predicts the group to which the current object that is being observed belongs to
   - Using the Sigmoid function we receive a outcome that is become 0 and 1 (Non-inclusive). The will be transformed to a 0 or 1 using a threshold classifier
       - Sigmoid Function is an S-Shaped curve that takes any real value and maps it to a range between 0 and 1
   - Measures relationship between dependent(What we want to predict) and one or more independent variables(Features) by estimating the probabilities using underlying logistic functions
       - Probabilites are transformed to binary values(Using sigmoid function) to make prediction
