# Multiple Linear Regression

### What is multiple linear regression?

In multiple linear regression we want to model the relationship between two or more features.

y = b0 + (x1)(b1) + (x2)(b2) + ... + (xn)(bn)

Where y is the dependent variable and Xi is the multiple independent variables 

Assumptions made for the multiple linear regression model(MLR):
  - Linearity: Relationship between independent and dependent variable is linear
  - Constant variance of the error should be maintained
  - Multivariaty Normality: MLR assumes residuals are normally distributed
  - Lack of multicollinearity: Assume little to no multicollinearity in the data
