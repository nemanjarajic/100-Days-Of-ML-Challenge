### Important Libraries
  - Numpy: Support for large multi-dimensional arrays and hosts a large collections of high-level math function that can be used to operate on arrays.
  - Pandas: Data analysis and manipulation tool for working with relational and labeled data
  - Scikit-learn: Machine learning library
  ```
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  pip install scikit-learn
  ```
  #### Note: If there are any issues using the pip package manager on the M1 chip the Conda package manager is a great alternative
